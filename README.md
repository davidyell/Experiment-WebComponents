#Web Components Experiment
So I wanted to have a play around with some of the new Web Components and see how they work and if I could create one.  

This is based off the [Google Web Components](http://html5-demos.appspot.com/static/webcomponents/index.html#1) presentation, and also the [Google IO presentation](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2txPYQOWBtg).   

##Usage
You will need to have the very latest version of Chrome, called Canary (apparently), which is v24+. Then you need to enable a few experimental features in the browser.  

I have used [X-Tags](http://www.x-tags.org/) Polyfill, which is basically a Javascript shim to make the X-Tags work in all browsers.  

Simply clone the repo and load the `index.html` in Chrome.
